# Kusto Query Language - Beginning Operators

## Introduction

This is the second course in the Pluralsight Kusto Query Language Learning Path. It coveres a beginning set of KQL operators. With these operators you should be able to author effective queries right away.

Each folder corresponds to the module number in the course, and contains code samples and corresponding text. Note that module 1 was a voice over script, and module 2 was the introduction. It and module 7 have no demos, their contents can be found in the PowerPoint slides.

Each folder uses the naming convention _mm.cc_subject_, where _mm_ is the module number, _cc_ is the clip number within the module, and _subject_ is the subject of the clip. For example, 03.01_Search is module 3, clip 1, and the subject of that clip is the search operator.

Inside each folder is a markdown file. This contains the contents of a blog post I did on my [ArcaneCode](http://arcanecode.com) blog. These were not used as an exact script but rather as the basis for the video presentation. The accompanying PNG files were the images captured for the blog post.

Each folder also contains two KQL files. The first will have the naming convention of _mm.cc-Demo-subject.kql_. This is the demo that was used in the actual course. The second KQL file is the demo file that accompanied the original blog post.

While these will be similar, there may be some differences for several reasons. First, demos may have been altered or arranged from the original print (blog) format to fit the video format. Second, Microsoft is constantly updating the sample database, the environment, and the language. In some cases demos needed to be altered to fit the changes to the Log Analytics demo site.
