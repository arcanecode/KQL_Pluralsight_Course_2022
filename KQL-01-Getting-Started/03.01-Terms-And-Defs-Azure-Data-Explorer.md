# Module 3 - Clip 1 - Terms and Definitions - Azure Data Explorer


Exploring the terms and definitions around KQL can be best illustrated in the context of the enviornments KQL can be used in. We'll start with the Azure Data Explorer.

You can get to the samples Microsoft provides by going to:

https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples

_Have a slide over with the URL appear._

You'll also find this in the downloads.

Here, we are automatically connected to a **cluster** named **help**. You can think of a cluster as a database server, although obviously not exactly the same. 

_Highlight help_

You can access the clusters you create via the **Add cluster** button.

_Highlight the Add cluster button_

Within the help cluster are databases.

_Highlight the list of databases_

Let's pick one of the databases to expand, how about we use **SampleMetrics**. In it you can see branches with functions, views, and links to external tables. _Highlight these three items_

In addition you can see a list of tables within the SampleMetrics database. If we pick one and expand it, such as **Alerts**, you can see the columns contained in the table. _Highlight the columns_

Let's look at one other item. We'll expand the Samples database. In it, you can see a folder labeled tables. _Highlight the folder_

With tables expanded, you see more folders. If we expand Storm_Events, you'll see two tables. _Highlight the two tables_, population data and storm events.

It's important to understand that these are not nested tables. Azure simply allows you to create folders, into which you can group tables. This is an optional feature, but in a large database can make it easier to find tables.












































d the database *samples*, _expand samples_ you'll see branches for functions, materialized views, tables, and external tables.

_Highlight the grouping_

Lets expand the tables, and we'll see the list of tables in the samples database. _Highlight Tables_

We can expand one of the tables, how about for this demo we use Storm_Events. 



**Start at https://portal.azure.com/#allservices**

We'll start on the All Services page of the Azure Portal. As we scroll down there are many services Azure offers, for monitoring 

**Scroll to Monitor**

![Monitoring - Log Analytics](01.01-monitor-log-analytics.png)

**Point out Log Analytics Workspaces**
_Highlight the Log Analytics Workspaces_

Explain that Azure creates several places for tracking your infrastructure. One of those places is Log Analytics, which we'll be using heavily in this series of courses.

Now click on it to open Log Analytics

## Formatting Guide

The notes in this file are used during the recording of the course. It is not meant to be a word for word script, but rather the talking points used for recording.

Notes in plain text are to be used during the recording.

**Notes in bold are instructions during recording, not to be spoken.**

_Notes in italic will be used during the video editing processing._

KQL doesn't have a predefined code setting in Markdown. Use python as the closest match for multi-line code samples.
