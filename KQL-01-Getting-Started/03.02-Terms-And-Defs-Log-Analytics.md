# Module 3 - Clip 2 - Terms and Definitions - Log Analytics

Microsoft provides many monitoring tools in Azure, one of the most popular is Log Analytics. Microsoft has a site with sample data you can use at https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/DemoLogsBlade. _Put the URL on the screen_. You can also find this URL in the download notes.

Behind the scenes this is stored in a cluster, but Microsoft has picked the name of the Cluster, in this case Logs. _Callout over the Logs name_

Within the Logs cluster we're connected to the sample database, Demo _Highlight the Demo db name_.

Across the top of the data management pane we have the tables _highlight tables_, which is currently selected, along with access to the queries and functions which we'll touch on later.

The list of tables have been organized by Microsoft into folders. _Highlight the block of folders_.

Let's expand the LogManagement folder, to show all of its tables. **Scroll down** As you can see there are a lot. One in particular we'll use in this series of courses is the Perf table. **Expand the Perf table**

If we expand it, you'll see all of its columns. Beside the column name is the columns data type in parenthesis. _Highlight several data types_

## Formatting Guide

The notes in this file are used during the recording of the course. It is not meant to be a word for word script, but rather the talking points used for recording.

**Notes in bold are instructions during recording, not to be spoken.**

_Notes in italic will be used during the video editing processing._

KQL doesn't have a predefined code setting in Markdown. Use python as the closest match for multi-line code samples.
