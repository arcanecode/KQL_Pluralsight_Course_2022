# Module 3 - Clip 2 - Terms and Definitions - Log Analytics

Microsoft provides many monitoring tools in Azure, one of the most popular is Log Analytics.

We'll use the URL seen earlier in this course to jump directly to it.

**For easy reference, here it is: https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/DemoLogsBlade**

You'll see the word Demo appear, this represents the scope of the query. With your Azure hosted applications you may have multiple log analytics workspaces or other resources being monitored. Clicking on the name will allow you to change the scope, although in this environment we only have one scope: demo.

Across the top of the data management pane we have the Tables _highlight tables_, which is currently selected, along with access to the queries and functions which we'll touch on later.

The list of tables has been organized by Microsoft into folders. _Highlight the block of folders_.

Let's expand the LogManagement folder, to show all of its tables. **Scroll down** As you can see there are a lot. One in particular we'll use in this series of courses is the Perf table. **Expand the Perf table**

If we expand it, you'll see all of its columns. Beside the column name is the columns data type in parenthesis. _Highlight several data types_

## Formatting Guide

The notes in this file are used during the recording of the course. It is not meant to be a word for word script, but rather the talking points used for recording.

Notes in plain text are to be used during the recording.

**Notes in bold are instructions during recording, not to be spoken.**

_Notes in italic will be used during the video editing processing._

KQL doesn't have a predefined code setting in Markdown. Use python as the closest match for multi-line code samples.
