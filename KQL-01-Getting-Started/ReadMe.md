# Kusto Query Language: Getting Started

This folder contains the support files for my Pluralsight course, Kusto Query Language: Getting Started.

The files with a KQL extension are the code samples used in the course.

Files with MD are markdown files that contained my notes used during the creation of the course. They are not an exact script, but close. They will serve as a good reminder for elements presented in the videos.

There is also a PowerBI sample with a PBIX extension.

If you downloaded this from the Pluralsight page for the course, these files will remain static. If you are viewing them on my GitHub site, they will be updated with errata. As new courses are added their files will be added in other folders.
