# Module 2 - Clip 3 - Where Should KQL Be Used

Azure Data Explorer 1-2min

Monitoring Tools 1-2min
As you’re talking about Azure, don’t just have a screenshot; narrate over typing the query StormData sort by…. and then show the results. Or, you mention creating a cluster and exploring it - show it.  Talk about why someone would use Azure Data Explorer while showing them. It doesn’t have to cover all the features of Azure Data Explorer, but again, a highlight reel, etc.
Overall you want people leaving convinced that KQL is a good solution for their data problems and excited to continue on and learn more.


## Formatting Guide

The notes in this file are used during the recording of the course. It is not meant to be a word for word script, but rather the talking points used for recording.

Notes in plain text are to be used during the recording.

**Notes in bold are instructions during recording, not to be spoken.**

_Notes in italic will be used during the video editing processing._

KQL doesn't have a predefined code setting in Markdown. Use python as the closest match for multi-line code samples.
