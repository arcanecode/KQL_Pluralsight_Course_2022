# Module 4 - Clip 1 - Data Pane

Clip 1 will dive deeper into the data pane. I’ll show how to explore the data types, get detailed information on a table, and so on. I’ll then show the built in queries.

## Formatting Guide

The notes in this file are used during the recording of the course. It is not meant to be a word for word script, but rather the talking points used for recording.

Notes in plain text are to be used during the recording.

**Notes in bold are instructions during recording, not to be spoken.**

_Notes in italic will be used during the video editing processing._

KQL doesn't have a predefined code setting in Markdown. Use python as the closest match for multi-line code samples.
