# Module 4 - Clip 2 - Help Menu

Clip 2 will show the help menu, it has 7 items worth exploring.

Let's now take a quick look at the tools in the upper right corner. _Highlight the tool area_

Feedback _Point to feedback_ is pretty obvious, **Click on it** when you click on it a pop up appears that allows you to provide feedback to Microsoft.

The next option is Queries. _point to it_ **tclick on it**. This brings up the same list of queries that appeared in the data pane, only now with more information.

If you hover over a query, _point to run_ you can run it, or load it into the editor _point to load_

Let's take a look at the menu on the very right. Starting at the bottom is the Community area. _Highlight it_. From there you can jump to the forums and git hub repositories associated with KQL and Log Analytics.

Next up are the Using and Getting started areas, _highlight them_ which brings up more info specifically on Log Analytics.

Above that is What's new, where you can see the latest improvements. _Highlight it_

A menu item you'll use frequently is the Language Reference. _Highlight it_ This takes you to the Microsoft Documentation for the Kusto Query Language.

Finally, at the top, is the Online Course. _Highlight it_ If we click on it...

A new page opens which takes you the original Pluralsight course for KQL, done by, of all people, me! _Point to my name_ Be aware this was the first version of the course and is a few years old.

Due to the increasing importance of KQL within Azure, we've chosen to update and expand the course, breaking it down into a series of individual courses, the course you are currently viewing is the first in the series.

OK, it's time to go write some KQL!

**Proceed to [04.03-Log-Analytics-Demo-First-KQL-Query.md](./04.03-Log-Analytics-Demo-First-KQL-Query.md)

## Formatting Guide

The notes in this file are used during the recording of the course. It is not meant to be a word for word script, but rather the talking points used for recording.

Notes in plain text are to be used during the recording.

**Notes in bold are instructions during recording, not to be spoken.**

_Notes in italic will be used during the video editing processing._

KQL doesn't have a predefined code setting in Markdown. Use python as the closest match for multi-line code samples.
