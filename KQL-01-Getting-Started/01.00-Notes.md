# Notes

The notes in this file are used during the recording of the course. It is not meant to be a word for word script, but rather the talking points used for recording.

Notes in plain text are to be used during the recording.

**Notes in bold are instructions during recording, not to be spoken.**

_Notes in italic will be used during the video editing processing._


Module 02 
Clip 1 - Who should be using KQL - Go deeper within each role with examples we can see.  1 sentence per role doesn’t paint the picture that an actual use case with examples would.
IT 1-2min
Data Analyst 1-2min
Report Writers 1-2min
Clip 2 - Purpose of KQL
Exploration and Patterns 1-2min
Anomalies and Outliers  1-2min
Stat models and more…  1-2min
Don’t just read a definition - show us that it’s a powerful tool for exploration and patterns, show us anomalies and outliers, show us a stat model and more.  Think of it as a highlight reel instead of a demo. Learners want to see, not just have a definition.

Clip 3 - Where should KQL be used?


Azure Data Explorer 1-2min


Exploration and Patterns

```python
let min_peak_t=datetime(2016-08-23 15:00);
let max_peak_t=datetime(2016-08-23 15:02);
demo_clustering1
  | where PreciseTimeStamp between(min_peak_t..max_peak_t)
  | evaluate autocluster()
```

Under the count column we see there are 639 rows that are contained in the pattern of eau Region, su7 ScaleUnit, DeploymentId b5d1d4df547d4a04ac15885617edba57, and ServiceHost of e7f60c5d-4944-42b3-922a-92e98a8e7dec. This pattern represents 65.74% of the rows in our data. Likewise, subsequent rows represent additional patterns.

Be aware that some rows might be represented in few (partially overlapping) patterns , and some rows are not represented in any pattern. The goal of autocluster is to transform a big table to a very small list of informative and divergent patterns, thus presenting the user significant multi-dimensional patterns for quick and efficient drill down and further investigation for the root cause.


Stat Model - 

Add Cluster
https://help.kusto.windows.net 
Pick Samples database

```
let min_t = toscalar(demo_make_series1 | summarize min(TimeStamp));
let max_t = toscalar(demo_make_series1 | summarize max(TimeStamp));
demo_make_series1
    // Create a data series, for each OS Version sum the number of eents by date 
  | make-series NumberOfEvents=count() default=0 
             on TimeStamp 
           from min_t to max_t step 1h 
             by OsVer
    // Rendering as a timechart can make it a bit easier to digest
  | render timechart 
```



Monitoring Tools 1-2min
As you’re talking about Azure, don’t just have a screenshot; narrate over typing the query StormData sort by…. and then show the results. Or, you mention creating a cluster and exploring it - show it.  Talk about why someone would use Azure Data Explorer while showing them. It doesn’t have to cover all the features of Azure Data Explorer, but again, a highlight reel, etc.
Overall you want people leaving convinced that KQL is a good solution for their data problems and excited to continue on and learn more.

Module 03  

Images are cut off… and this was more of an interface tour than an intro to KQL
Clip 1 - Azure Data Explorer Interface - Talk about the definitions and then show us the hierarchy drill down with live footage and not a screen shot, keeps things moving instead of one screen shot on the screen for 45sec
Clusters
Database
Table
Columns
Data types
Clip 2 - Monitoring Tools from Azure Interface - again, show us live with callouts, keeps things moving
Logs
Database
Table Groups
Change Group Methods
Tables
Columns
Data Types
Clip 3 - KQL Query vs SQL Query. MISSING

When you show us it allows for more narration - example - type a query and tell your learner to observe the autocomplete.  Also, SQL queries start with columns, what about KQL? Talk about starting with the table name and then pipe characters.
Example - if you know SQL
SELECT * FROM ConferenceSessions WHERE conference = 'Pluralsight Live 2022'
in KQL it would look like
ConferenceSessions
| where conference == 'Pluralsight Live 2022'
talk about the syntax, differences, learning curve,



## Demo 1 Data Terms and Definitions

**Start at https://portal.azure.com/#allservices**

We'll start on the All Services page of the Azure Portal. As we scroll down there are many services Azure offers, for monitoring 

**Scroll to Monitor**

![Monitoring - Log Analytics](01.01-monitor-log-analytics.png)

**Point out Log Analytics Workspaces**
_Highlight the Log Analytics Workspaces_

Explain that Azure creates several places for tracking your infrastructure. One of those places is Log Analytics, which we'll be using heavily in this series of courses.

Now click on it to open Log Analytics






## Module 4 - Clip 1

Clip 1 will dive deeper into the data pane. I’ll show how to explore the data types, get detailed information on a table, and so on. I’ll then show the built in queries.

## Module 4 - Clip 2

Clip 2 will show the help menu, it has 7 items worth exploring.

## Module 4 - Clip 3

In clip 3 I’ll run the first KQL query, explaining how a very basic query works, and showing some of the controls around running queries such as the time range.

## Module 4 - Clip 4

In the final clip I’ll show the query output pane, explain how to sort the data, and how to use the new columns pane to rearrange the output columns, add and remove columns from the output, etc.
