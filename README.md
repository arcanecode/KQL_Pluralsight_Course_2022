# Kusto Query Language - Pluralsight

## Overview

This project contains code samples for a series of courses done for Pluralsight, on the Kusto Query Language. This series of courses was created beginning in 2022.

Each folder contains the code samples for a course. See the individual folder for each course for more details on the course.

You can find a list of all my courses at the Info page on my blog, [http://arcanecode.me](http://arcanecode.me). As new KQL courses are created they will be added to this info page.

## Environment

These samples were developed using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). It used the native Markdown capability. For proper formatting of the Kusto demos, you should also install the suite of [Kuskus] extensions. There are four:

* [Kuskus] Kusto Syntax Highlighting
* [Kuskus] Kusto Language Server
* [Kuskus] Kusto extensions pack
* [Kuskus] Kusto Color Themes

The last one is optional.

## Pluralsight Download vs GitHub

These files are available in two locations, as a download from the course page on Pluralsight, or from my GitHub site. If you download them from Pluralsight, they will remain static and always match the content of the course.

If you access them through GitHub, note that there may be minor differences due to bug fixes or course errata. However the GitHub site will make for easy viewing, removing the need to install VSCode and extensions if you do not already have them installed.
